# Code-Quiz-Javascript
The goal of the assignment was to create a working application in the form of a quiz. I found some parts of the criteria quite easy to achieve, but unfortunately found a lot of difficulty in certain parts like the end screen/high school page. I understand i was to use the set local storage method, but couldn't quite grasp how to get it functioning. Although the assignment isn't fully completed to my liking I'm happy with how far I've gotten overall. 



## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score.
